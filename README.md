Shannon is a young man from Opportunity who dreams of becoming a doctor. He's currently a certified nurse interning under Doctor Harvey and rooms with Cecilia.

He's far from normal, however, but doesn't know exactly why.



He is meant to work with Denver and Cecilia, and I haven't made an option for him to be standalone yet, which is why he is currently not published anywhere.



- Lives at Cecilia's house
- Has events dependent on both Denver and Cecilia
